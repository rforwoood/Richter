THE FEATURES
EXAMPLE GAMEPLAY[i]


Players are introduced from off screen left. Controls are briefly displayed. Players get used to controls on simple, small groups of mobs. Players then progress onto harder mobs and are given consumables, which they use to defeat them. Hazards have distinct visual cues that indicate the players should avoid them. Players progress through rising incremented difficulty and eventually reach the boss mob. Players fight boss mob and receive a victory screen if they win.


FEATURE [j]#1


Inventory System: Each player has two consumable slots (one for healing/shield, and one for damaging mobs/buffing player) which each hold 1 pickup that players find as they defeat enemies/progress through the level.


FEATURE [k]#2


Revive system: Revive ally.
