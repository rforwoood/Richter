* When creating photoshop documents for sprites make sure the resolution is divisible into 100x100 pixel segments, for relative scaling that is a 1x1 plane in unity!
* To see how objects scale against each other create planes in unity and scale them using their transform to make them  the appropriate size (i.e. 22x10 = 2200 x 1000 pixels)
* To see completed sprites in the game download the current version of the game posted on drive and import them as textures, and apply them to planes.
